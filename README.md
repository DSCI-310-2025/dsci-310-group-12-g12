# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Project Summary
This project aims to predict whether a customer will default on a credit card payment based on various financial and demographic features. The dataset used includes information about customersâ€™ credit history, payment status, demographic data, and other relevant factors. We will use machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting.

The goal is to build a reliable model that can classify whether a customer is at risk of default, which can help financial institutions make more informed lending decisions.

## Data Description
The data used to build our model contains customer information, including payment history, demographic details, and financial behavior. The dataset was collected from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and is specifically referred to as the "Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset." This dataset contains information about credit card clients in Taiwan and is available for download at the following URL:

## Usage

## Reproducibility and Execution

We use a Docker container image to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment for this project. There are two main ways to run the project:

1. **Non-interactive execution**: This method is ideal for those who wish to reproduce the results of our analysis. It allows you to run the project in an automated, non-interactive manner.
   
2. **Interactive execution**: This method is ideal for project developers and collaborators who want to run, edit, and explore the project interactively in Jupyter Lab.
